All the libraries and code for SEDS, LPV-DS, different GMM estimation techniques, different modulation approaches and compliant control techniques have been provided in Matlab for the course homeworks in [https://github.com/meam6230-course-code/meam6230-hw](https://github.com/meam6230-course-code/meam6230-hw). 

Yet, many of these approaches have open-source implementations in Python and/or C++ that could be easier to integrate into your simulation for the final project. Hence, below we provide a list of Python and C++ implementations of the different techniques we have seen in class as well as direct improvements. 

- **standalone lpv-ds optimization (matlab):** The LPV-DS optimization algorithm used in the homeworks can be found as a stand-alone repository here [https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt)
- **standalone lpv-ds optimization (python):** A python version of the above using CVXPY can be found here [https://github.com/penn-figueroa-lab/ds-opt-py](https://github.com/penn-figueroa-lab/ds-opt-py) and [https://github.com/penn-figueroa-lab/lpvds](https://github.com/penn-figueroa-lab/lpvds)
- **standalone pc-gmm sampling (matlab):** The PC-GMM sampling algorithm used in the homeworks can be found as a stand-alone repository here [https://github.com/nbfigueroa/phys-gmm](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/phys-gmm)
- **standalone pc-gmm sampling (python):**  A python version of PC-GMM can be found here [https://github.com/penn-figueroa-lab/phys_gmm_python](https://github.com/penn-figueroa-lab/phys_gmm_python)
- **standalone damm sampling (c++/Python):** A highly optimized C++ code implementing the paralell sampling scheme for the directionality-aware mixture model [(DAMM)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530930) which is leaps and bounds faster than pc-gmm. 
- **standalone gaussian mixture regression (python):**  A useful and lightweight python library on gaussian mixture regression (GMR) [https://github.com/AlexanderFabisch/gmr](https://github.com/AlexanderFabisch/gmr)
- **passive DS controller within Franka-ROS (C++/Python):** If you are familiar with ROS and Gazebo and want to use the passive-DS controller, classical impedance controller or even implement your own controller you might find this library, which is an add-on to the [franka_ros](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/franka_ros.html) library, useful: [franka_interactive_controllers](https://github.com/penn-figueroa-lab/franka_interactive_controllers)
- **robo-agnostic admittance controller (ROS-Node):** A robot-agnostic [admittance controller](https://github.com/penn-figueroa-lab/robot_admittance_controller) implemented in C++ as a ROS NODE. It takes in values of an FT message and outputs desired linear and angular velocities
